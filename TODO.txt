* it would be good if objects could only be instantiated in the right nesting
  order, e.g. you wouldn't do cell = Cell.new, but you'd do
  cell = Row.create_cell and the nesting is automatically handled for you.
  I think the way to do this is to require the containing object to be passed
  (recursively) to the constructors, while create_foo internally does this,
  passing self to the constructor.
