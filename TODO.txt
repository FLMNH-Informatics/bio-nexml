* parser.parse_tree wants to add a rootedge, i.e. an edge that has a target
  (the root), but not a source. In the commented-out implementation, it does
  this by calling add_rootedge, a method that doesn't exist. Some hackery needs
  to make this possible, because as it stands, no edges that don't have a source
  node associated with them seem to be allowed by the superclasses Bio::Tree and
  upwards.
