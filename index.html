<p>
NeXML is a file format for phylogenetic data. It is inspired by the modular
architecture of the commonly-used NEXUS file format (hence the name) in
that a NeXML instance document can contain:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sets of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), i.e. the tips in phylogenetic
trees, and that which comparative observations are made on. Often these are
species (&quot;taxa&quot;).

</li>
<li>sets of phylogenetic trees (or reticulate trees, i.e. networks)

</li>
<li>sets of comparative data, i.e. molecular sequences, morphological
categorical data, continuous data, and other types.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The elements in a NeXML document can be annotated using RDFa
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa), which means that every object that can
be parsed out of a NeXML document must be an object that, in turn, can be
annotated with predicates (and their namespaces) and other objects (with,
perhaps, their own namespaces). The advantage over previous file formats is
that we can retain all metadata for all objects within one file, regardless
where the metadata come from.
</p>
<p>
NeXML can be transformed to RDF using an XSL stylesheet. As such, NeXML
forms an intermediate format between traditional flat file formats (with
predictable structure but no semantics) and RDF (with loose structure, but
lots of semantics) that is both easy to work with, yet ready for the
Semantic Web.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/NeXML_and_RDF_API_for_BioRuby
</p>
<p>
It is not complete, but definitely enough to get started.
</p>
<h2>Contributing to bio-nexml</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn&#8217;t been
implemented or the bug hasn&#8217;t been fixed yet

</li>
<li>Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn&#8217;t
requested it and/or contributed it

</li>
<li>Fork the project

</li>
<li>Start a feature/bugfix branch

</li>
<li>Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution

</li>
<li>Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don&#8217;t break it
in a future version unintentionally.

</li>
<li>Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want
to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but
please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

</li>
